Early-Onset vs. Late-Onset Diabetes Risk Prediction Using NHANES Data

Overview

This project was developed as part of the ISYE 6414 Regression Analysis course at Georgia Institute of Technology. It explores risk prediction models for diabetes using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), with a focus on age-stratified analysis.

Our primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of classification models in predicting diabetes onset among two distinct age groups:

Early-Onset: Individuals under 40 years old
Late-Onset: Individuals aged 40 and above
While prior studies typically evaluate predictive models on the general population, our approach diverges by assessing performance within age-specific cohorts. This allows us to identify age-dependent risk patterns that may be obscured in an aggregate analysis.

Goals

Leverage generalized linear models (GLMs)—specifically logistic regression and random forest to predict diabetes risk.
Build interpretable and statistically sound models using various clinical and demographic predictors.
Compare model performance and consistency across early-onset and late-onset age groups.
Contribute to the literature by highlighting age-specific predictors and their influence on diabetes risk.

My Contribution

This repository reflects my individual contribution to the team project, with a focus on:

-Logistic Regression Modeling for the ≥40 Age Group
-Feature selection, multicollinearity checks, and model diagnostics
-Interpretation of age-specific predictors and model performance evaluation
